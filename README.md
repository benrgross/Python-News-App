## Description

This application allows the user to view a dashboard of news articles, follow the link to the article, view comments by other other users, or comment themselves. The user can sign up and log in using their email and password. Once the user is logged in they can post their own news links, add a summery, and comment on whatever they post they choose.

The Python News App is a basic CRUD app that utilized Python and a Flask API. The application is connected to an MySQL database using SQL Alchemy to support the API model. Custom decorator functions were created to act as route middleware. JINJA was employed as the templating engine to render the Python data from our backend.
